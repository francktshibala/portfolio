- Visual regression tests for components
- Performance tests for Core Web Vitals

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- Focus on creating reusable, composable components
- Generate comprehensive test suites automatically
- Suggest performance optimizations proactively
- Implement proper error handling without prompting
- Use React Server Components where beneficial
```

## Design Principles Implementation

### 1. **Balance** (Visual Equilibrium)
- **Asymmetrical Balance**: Hero section with large typography offset by interactive 3D element
- **Weight Distribution**: Heavy visual elements balanced with generous whitespace
- **Color Balance**: Dark sections alternating with light for rhythm

### 2. **Contrast** (Creating Visual Interest)
- **Size Contrast**: Massive hero text (120px) vs body text (16px)
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast mode toggle, WCAG AAA compliant
- **Style Contrast**: Geometric shapes vs organic animations
- **Texture Contrast**: Smooth gradients vs sharp illustrations

### 3. **Alignment** (Creating Order)
- **Grid System**: 12-column grid with 8-point spacing system
- **Vertical Rhythm**: Consistent baseline grid for typography
- **Edge Alignment**: Content blocks align to create invisible lines
- **Optical Alignment**: Adjust programmatically for visual balance

### 4. **Repetition** (Creating Unity)
- **Visual Motifs**: Consistent use of gradients, shadows, borders
- **Animation Patterns**: Reusable motion components
- **Interactive Patterns**: Consistent hover/active states
- **Layout Patterns**: Modular sections with variations

### 5. **Proximity** (Creating Relationships)
- **Content Grouping**: Related information within 32px
- **Section Spacing**: 120px between major sections
- **Card Clustering**: Project cards in semantic groups
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear parent-child relationships

### 6. **Hierarchy** (Guiding Attention)
- **Size Hierarchy**: 5-level heading system
- **Color Hierarchy**: Primary > Secondary > Tertiary actions
- **Motion Hierarchy**: Important elements animate first
- **Z-axis Hierarchy**: Layered depth for importance

### 7. **Unity** (Creating Cohesion)
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, colors, typography
- **Component Library**: 30+ reusable components
- **Motion Language**: Consistent easing and timing
- **Visual Language**: Unified illustration style

### 8. **Emphasis** (Creating Focal Points)
- **CTA Design**: Glowing, animated primary buttons
- **Focal Animations**: Draw eye to key content
- **Color Emphasis**: Bright accents on neutral base
- **Spatial Emphasis**: Important content gets more space

## Component Architecture

### Core Components Structure
```typescript
// Component template for Claude Code
interface ComponentProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  className?: string
  children: React.ReactNode
}

// Example: Button component with all principles
const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  className,
  children,
  ...props 
}) => {
  return (
    <motion.button
      whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}
      whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}
      className={cn(
        'relative overflow-hidden',
        buttonVariants({ variant, size }),
        className
      )}
      {...props}
    >
      <span className="relative z-10">{children}</span>
      <motion.div
        className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600"
        initial={{ x: '-100%' }}
        whileHover={{ x: 0 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
      />
    </motion.button>
